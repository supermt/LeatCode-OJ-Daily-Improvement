# 部门最高工资

## 问题：

给出雇员、部门表，从两表中选出具有最高工资的雇员（注意，如果出现相同的员工应该同时出现）

雇员表

Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId
-- | ----- | ------ | ------------
1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1
2  | Henry | 80000  | 2
3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2
4  | Max   | 90000  | 1

部门表

Id | Name
-- | -----
1  | IT
2  | Sales

查询结果应该如下

Department | Employee | Salary
---------- | -------- | ------
IT         | Max      | 90000
Sales      | Henry    | 80000

## 解答

```sql
select
D.Name as Department,temp.Name as Employee,temp.Salary as Salary
from Department as D,
(select Name,Salary,DIdtemp from Employee as E,
(select max(Salary) as Max,DepartmentId as DIdtemp,Id from Employee group by DepartmentId) as init
where E.Salary = init.Max and E.DepartmentId=init.DIdtemp) as temp
where D.Id=temp.DIdtemp
```

这道题在一开始的时候我做错了两次

```sql
select D.Name as Department,E.Name as Employee,Max(Salary) as Salary
from Employee as E,Department as D
where E.DepartmentId=D.Id group by D.Id
```

本来没什么问题，但是没办法将同时具有最高工资的雇员选出来

```sql
select D.Name as Department,E.Name as Employee,E.Salary as Salary
from Employee as E,Department as D where E.DepartmentId=D.Id and E.Salary
in
(select max(Salary) as Max from Employee group by DepartmentId)
order by D.Id
```

这个答案是取巧的，忽略了如果第二个部门的最高工资和第一个部门中某个不是最高工资的雇员相同时的情况。
